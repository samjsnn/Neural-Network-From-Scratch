# Neural-Network-From-Scratch
Neural Network from scratch implemented with CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification

The program is implementing a small neural network for classification tasks. It trains the network using the provided training data, calculates the loss and accuracy, and performs experiments to evaluate the impact of different learning rates and mini-batch sizes on the network's performance.
